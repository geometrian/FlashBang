#An Android distance calculator from light and sound

When an event happens (for example, a lightning strike), it can produce light and sound.  Since light travels much faster than sound, you see the event before you hear it.  Using the time difference, you can actually calculate the distance.

Many apps exist that purport to calculate distance to an event in this way.  Unfortunately, these are universally moronic affairs, with a button you press when you see the event and another when you hear it.  This is horrendously inaccurate and can be confusing, especially for nearby events.

By contrast, this app does the detection automatically, and correlates events with extremely high precision.  When possible, this app also corrects for temperature, humidity, and the speed of light.
