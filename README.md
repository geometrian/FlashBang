## An Android distance calculator from light and sound

### Introduction

When an event happens (for example, a lightning strike), it can produce light and sound.  Since light travels much faster than sound, you see the event before you hear it.  Using the time difference, you can actually calculate the distance.

### Motivation and Features

Many apps exist that purport to calculate distance to an event in this way.  Unfortunately, these are universally moronic affairs, with a button you press when you see the event and another when you hear it.  This is horrendously inaccurate and can be confusing, especially for nearby events.

By contrast, this app does the detection automatically, and correlates events with extremely high precision.  When possible, this app also corrects for temperature, humidity, and the speed of light.

### Usage

To use, simply point your Android device at the event and observe.  The app will attempt to discern anomalous sound and light and will automatically produce the readout of the distance.  The associated readouts tell you which factors were used in the calculation.
